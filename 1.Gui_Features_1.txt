Getting Started with Images
Goals

    Here, you will learn how to read an image, how to display it and how to save it back
    You will learn these functions : cv2.imread(), cv2.imshow() , cv2.imwrite()
    Optionally, you will learn how to display images with Matplotlib

Using OpenCV

Read an image

Use the function cv2.imread() to read an image. The image should be in the working directory or a full path of image should be given.

Second argument is a flag which specifies the way image should be read.

    cv2.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default flag.
    cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode
    cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel














Using Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python which gives you wide variety of plotting methods. You will see them in coming articles. 
Here, you will learn how to display image with Matplotlib. You can zoom images, save it etc using Matplotlib.
